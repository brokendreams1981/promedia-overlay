ProMedia Overlay
================

This is a gentoo overlay for professional audio and video media applications. There may be overlaps between this layer
and others, specifically the proaudio one, but this layer intends to build on top of standard Gentoo and not incorporate
any wierdness that causes blockages where they shouldn't be, e.g. lash-original!!!

Another aim is to for this to be as stable as possible. There may be packages which have no releases and are only
distributed via source repositories. I will aim to make sure that the downloaded source does build.
